"Gould" and "Mazzoleni" are our internal codenames for the boards. You'll also see these names printed on the PCBs, too. These names don't really mean anything; they're just our way of referring to the boards during development, when we don't have release-ready names for things quite yet.

**Gould** -> The Amplifier Board.
**Mazzoleni** -> The Driver Flex Boards.

Simple enough, eh?
